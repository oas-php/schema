looks like schema depends on phpdocumentor/reflection-common directly (constructor subscriber)
unify error messages:  Parameter "type" value must be one of: null, string, number, integer, boolean, array, object ("float" provided)
review everything and provide correct types (unions)
unit test with 100% cc
    -> schema instantiation tests
    -> schema is traversable tests
    -> schema may be created from primitives tests


idea for lib: assertType('array<int, stdClass>');
idea for lib: generate Postman collection from Document
